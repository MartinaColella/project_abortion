# Abortion in Italy (2012 - 2021)
Final project for the graduation at Spiced Academy. Analysis of abortions trends and accessibility in Italy in the past 10 years 

## Agenda
  1. Datasets information: What datasets I have used and what information did I get from each
  2. General information : historical background of abortion in Italy
  3. Trend Analysis
      - Are abortions increasing or decreasing? 
      - Are abortions getting safer?
  4. Accessibility to the service
      - Is abortion in Italy really accessible? 

## 1. Datasets
For this project I have used two main datasets:

   1. **ISTAT** ( National Institution for Statistics) 
            - The data comes from the document that doctors have to fill in before the procedure
            - Data available from 2012 until 2021 
            - data included: 
               - Personal Information of the woman
               - Details regarding the procedure 
            - data gathered from:
               -  Hospitals (public and private)
               -  Patient care centre (public and private)
             
   2. **ISS** (Superior Institution for Health) 
            - yearly report of the Minister of Health to the Parliament 
            - Data available from 2012 until 2020
            - Real number and percentage of concentious objectors per region
            **P.s.concentious objectors = doctors or medical stuff who, for personal beliefs, refuses to practise abortions** 
            
## 2. General Information

   ### LAW 194/78
Introduced the 22nd May 2978 it allows every woman to resort to abortion in the first 90 days from conception for health , economical , social or familiar reasons.
It allows doctors to be concentious objectors, but hospitals and care centres still must assure assure the accessibility to the procedure

## 3. Trand Analysis

  ### General trend 
Italy in general has one of the lowest abortion rates in the world (INSERT NUMBER), but the graph below "NAME"Â shows that abortions are generally decreasing with a drop of 39% in the past 10 years. The average drop percentage is between 2 and 5%, but in 2015 and 2020 the number of abortions dropped of more than 8%. Why that?

  - 2015: The emergency contraception pill (plan B pill) can be sold in pharmacies without medical prescription to women over 18 years old
  - 2020: for two main reasons. On one hand the covid pandemic , but also emergency contraception pill can be sold withou medical prescription also to underaged women (this second aspect did not strongly influence the trend, as the percentage of abortions of underaged women is significantly lower). 

   ### Trend by type of abortion
In order to answer the question whether are abortion getting safer, I decided to dive into the type of abortions that are being executed.
There are different types of procedures which can be summerized into two main groups:
    1. **Chirurgical**
      Much more invasive and can be dangerous for the woman.
      They include : dilatation and curettage, Karman method and other methods of vacuum aspiration
    2. **Pharmaceutical**
      Conducted through the use of the abortion pill (P.s. different from the Plan B pill available in pharmacies). 
      They include the following drugs: prostaglandina only, mifepristone only, mifepristone and prostaglandina combined. 
  
In the graph_2 and graph_3 it seems clear that there is a positive trend in safety regarding abortions. For instance in 2012 chirurgical procedures were 90% of all abortions and in these past years they have dropped by 65% in total. On the contrary chirurgical abortions have been increasing by 2075% , resulting in an almost 50 - 50 distribution in 2020.

## 4. Accessibility to the service.
One of the main reasons why I decided to work on this topic as final project, is the big issue with accessibility to abortions. As stated at the beginning, the law allows doctors to object and 'solleva' from the duty to practise abortions, and how italian news state, 7 gynecologysts out of 10 are consentious objectors. This fact seemed to be crazy, so I decided to question the news with the data. 

Unfortunately the data confirms the news and as you can see in the graph below, the percentage of objectors gynecologists fluctates around 70% on a country level. However, data becomes even more alarming if we consider the percentage on a regional level, resulting in a very unconsistent percentage. There are regions (in light blue in the map gif) like Valle d'Aosta with a very low objector-rate (max 20%) , and regions, mostly spread in the south of the peninsula, with a very high rate.

   ### The case of Molise 
   
I decided to focus on Molise, a small region in the centre of Italy, known all over the country for being one of the most problematic regions when it comes to accessibility.

![Objectors - Molise](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121899817/225345297-1c2b568a-40f6-446a-868d-9ff2034d3c50.png)

As you can see in the graphs above, the objector-rate, mostly among gynecologists, is extremely high peaking up to 97% in 2016. Unfortunately the latest report of the Minister of Health available online is dated 2020, so we are still missing the numbers from 2021 and 2022. However, the news have shown that no matter the lower percentage in 2020 (80%) , things got worse. In 2021 there was only one doctor in the whole region willing to practise abortions, who was supposed to retire but could not because according to the law, the region still needs to provide the service. As a consequence, a colleague was'put at his side', but from the 1st of January 2022 he retired, leaving again only 1 doctor in the region. 

  ### The reasons for being objectors
Unlike you might expect, religion is not the main reason why doctors object to the practise. As a poll done by Silvia De Zorzo (anthropologist at the University of Barcelona) in 2011 - 2012, the main reason seems to be related to career. Below I will list the most common reasons: 
  1. **Career and professional life**
    - Discriminations by chiefs and colleagues 
    - Lack of gratification in the procedure 
    - Avoid spending most of the time doing abortions

  2. **Religious**
    - Belief that the embryo is a form of life that needs to be protected

  3. **Economical**
    - Abortion is not a practise that can be paid privately in public hospitals
    
## 5. Next steps    

  1. Dive into regional Analysis also regarding the type of abortions.
  2. How does politics affects accessibility and safety ? 
  3. Comparison with other European Countries
